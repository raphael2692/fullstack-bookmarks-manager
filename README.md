# Fullstack bookmarks manager (WIP)

Simple CRUD app based on FastAPI, SQL and React 


## Start

To start the backend run the docker compose file

```shell
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

The backend runs on localhost:80. Doc is accesible at localhost:80/docs

Frontend runs at localhost:3000


## Todo

- Replace SQLlite with Postgre running in a container
- Implement a "tag" field to the "Bookmark" entity using "Array" as default type
- Implement Update functionality
- Avoid full page refresh on operations
